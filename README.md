This Fiji plugin provides a table to interactively set the names associated to the Roi group integer indexes (easier than the ImageJ built-in solution).  
(The .java files in the root of the directory are not used anymore, they were part of the original pull request for the roi group but were rewritten in jython for simplicity.)
